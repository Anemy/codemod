Plan:
- First make the backend work solid.
- Then build UI around it.
- Then get it to some folks.


Making the backend work solid:
- Use gpt-3 to make good suggestions.
  - First try without training our own model.
  - Give davinci the high level of the task and the folder structure. Ask it to do the mapping.
    - Does the code edit cover everything? Should we use davinci model?
    - How do we give the model the full context of the app.
    - How do we let the model create new files or delete, etc.
      - High level mapping first? Make it plan it.
- Integrate with git:
  - Create a new git branch, copy into a temp folder
  - Rebuild the current git folder off of the 
  - If it's not already git we do a git init so we can do a diff.



Down the line:
- Train our own model.
- Basic examples.
- Tester project
- Show diffs in ui.
- Server to handle requests and manage api usage.

How will the git integration work:
- Create a new branch
- Create a temp folder
  - Down the line maybe all the diff happens in that temp folder and its git
- Build the new files in the temp folder?
  - Should the ai be giving modifications? Or create new files.


Show the ai how to do one step, then repeat that for x files in the repo.
  EX: Getting rid of sass and moving to css in js.
